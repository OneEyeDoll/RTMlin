# RTMlin
Simple C# CLI GTA-V RTM that runs on linux.
## REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES TO BUILD
-Mono

-dotnet
## USAGE
Just take the last bin and run it with 

>>./RTMlin  

This tool works only with PS3MAPI. Tested both on online and single player, with an HEN PS3.
Start HEN, then use >>/connect, then insert your console's ip address. **RUN THE GAME, ONLY THEN USE /attach COMMAND!!**
As i said, this tool is very simple, and right now has only few mods:

-Sky color edit(use it to test if the tool works)

-Infinite ammos.

-GodMod.

## BUILDING

Just run

>>make

In the RTMlin folder
